# 🚀 R2 Asset Processor - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Transform your existing asset processor into a **flexible, reusable package** that can be used across multiple projects while keeping it simple and maintainable.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Enhancement (2 hours)

### 1.1 Update Processor Class

**File:** `lib/assets/processor.js`

**Key Improvements (implemented):**

- ✅ **Configuration object** instead of hardcoded values (reads `assets.config.js` or uses defaults)
- ✅ **Hooks system** for extensibility (supports `onProgress`, `onError`, `beforeUpload`, `afterUpload` hooks)
- ✅ **Quality mapping** based on image size (mobile-first quality presets)
- ✅ **Placeholder generation** (implemented; small base64 placeholders are stored in the manifest)
- ✅ **Better error handling** with recovery strategies (skips failed files, preserves manifest state)

**Notes:**

- The processor remains a single-file implementation with sensible defaults to avoid over-engineering.
- Default behavior is conservative: unchanged files are skipped and not re-uploaded unless content changes or `--force` is used.

### 1.2 Add Configuration Support

**File:** `assets.config.js` (root level)

```javascript
export default {
  sizes: [400, 800, 1200], // Mobile-first
  quality: { 400: 90, 800: 85, 1200: 80 },
  enableWebP: true,
  enableAVIF: true,
  enablePlaceholders: false, // Optional feature (see Placeholder section)
}
```

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Worker Intelligence (1 hour)

### 2.1 Smart Image Serving

**File:** `worker.js`

**Features (Free Tier Compatible):**

- ✅ **Format negotiation** - Detect browser support via Accept header
- ✅ **Save-Data support** - Serve smaller images on slow connections
- ✅ **Intelligent fallbacks** - AVIF → WebP → JPEG chain
- ✅ **Cache headers** - Immutable caching for performance

**What We're NOT Doing:**

- ❌ No on-the-fly transformation (requires paid plan)
- ❌ No complex routing rules
- ❌ No database or state management

### 2.2 Fallback Strategy

```
Request: profile-1200.avif
Fallback chain:
1. profile-1200.avif (exact match)
2. profile-1200.webp (format fallback)
3. profile-800.avif  (size fallback)
4. profile-800.webp  (combined fallback)
5. profile.jpg       (original)
```

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Package & Reusability (30 mins)

### 3.1 Setup Script

**File:** `lib/assets/setup.js`

**Auto-configures:**

- Creates `.env` with R2 credentials
- Updates `.gitignore`
- Creates folder structure
- Adds npm scripts
- Generates example config

### 3.2 Package Structure

```
lib/assets/
├── processor.js    # Core processor (enhanced)
├── sync.js        # CLI for processing
├── status.js      # Storage checker
├── setup.js       # One-time setup
├── package.json   # Package metadata
└── README.md      # Documentation
```

### 3.3 Usage in Other Projects

```bash
# Copy the lib/assets folder
cp -r lib/assets ../other-project/lib/

# Run setup
cd ../other-project
node lib/assets/setup.js

# Start using
npm run assets:sync
```

## Placeholder generation — Details (Implemented)

This section documents how the processor generates, stores, and consumes tiny placeholders used for progressive image loading (blur-up or LQIP).

How it works

- When `enablePlaceholders: true` (in `assets.config.js` or passed to `AssetProcessor`), the processor will generate a very small blurred image representation for each source file. The implementation uses `sharp` to resize the image to a tiny width (default 20px), optionally reduce quality, and then encode to `webp` (or keep original) and export as a base64 data URL.

What is stored in the manifest

- For each processed source file the manifest includes a `placeholder` object similar to:

```json
"images/profile.jpg": {
  "outputs": {
    "profile-400.webp": {"size":400,"hash":"..."},
    "profile-800.webp": {"size":800,"hash":"..."}
  },
  "placeholder": {
    "dataUrl": "data:image/webp;base64,...",
    "w": 20,
    "h": 12,
    "aspectRatio": 1.66
  }
}
```

How to enable

- Edit `assets.config.js` and set `enablePlaceholders: true` or instantiate the processor with `{ enablePlaceholders: true }`.
- Run `pnpm run assets:sync` (or `node lib/assets/sync.js`) to generate placeholders and update `public/assets-manifest.json`.

How to use in components

- `R2Image.astro` and `R2Picture.astro` will read `public/assets-manifest.json` at build time (or runtime in dev) and use the `placeholder.dataUrl` for the `blur`/`background-image` CSS or the `src` of a tiny inline image. They will also output the appropriate `width`/`height` attributes to avoid layout shift.

Verification

- After running the processor with placeholders enabled, open `public/assets-manifest.json` and confirm each entry has a `placeholder` object with a `dataUrl` string.
- Load the page in dev or a test build — you should see the blurred placeholder while the main image loads.

Notes & Edge Cases

- Placeholders increase manifest size slightly (base64 strings), keep the placeholder width small (10–32px) to limit growth.
- For very large batches you may prefer a flag to store placeholders as dedicated tiny files instead of inline base64. This is not the default to keep R2 object counts low.

const processor = new AssetProcessor({
  sizes: [400, 800], // Only two sizes needed
  enablePlaceholders: true, // For lazy loading
  rules: {
    '.png': { outputs: ['webp'], sizes: [400, 800] }, // WebP only
  },
})
```

1. **Backup manifest:** `cp public/assets-manifest.json public/assets-manifest.backup.json`
2. **Update processor:** Replace `lib/assets/processor.js`
3. **Add config:** Create `assets.config.js` (optional)
4. **Update worker:** Replace `worker.js`
5. **Test:** Run `npm run assets:sync` with `--dry-run`
6. **Deploy:** `npx wrangler deploy`

### For New Projects

1. **Copy folder:** `cp -r lib/assets new-project/lib/`
2. **Run setup:** `cd new-project && node lib/assets/setup.js`

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Current Performance

- 70-80% size reduction with WebP/AVIF
- Global CDN delivery
- Manual size selection in components

### After Enhancement

- **Same size reduction** (no change in quality)
- **Smarter delivery** (right format for each browser)
- **Faster fallbacks** (Worker handles missing variants)
- **Better mobile** (Save-Data support)
- **Easier maintenance** (configuration-driven)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Maintained Security

- ✅ Environment variables for credentials
- ✅ No secrets in code
- ✅ Gitignore for sensitive files
- ✅ Minimal R2 permissions

### New Considerations

- ⚠️ Validate config file inputs
- ⚠️ Sanitize file paths
- ⚠️ Rate limit considerations for Worker

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's

- ✅ Start with minimal config
- ✅ Test with small image set first
- ✅ Keep manifest backups
- ✅ Monitor R2 usage regularly
- ✅ Use version control for configs

### Don'ts

- ❌ Don't over-optimize (3 sizes is enough)
- ❌ Don't process unchanged files
- ❌ Don't ignore storage warnings
- ❌ Don't hardcode credentials
- ❌ Don't add features you don't need
